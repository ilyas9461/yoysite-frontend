# Dashboard : Playground Management System 
Front-end web pages that display various information about the administration of a Playground.
This information can be seen by the investor instantly, daily, monthly and with date intervals.
The system was developed with Vue 3 Framework in Dashboard structure.
In addition, many parameters such as price, promotion updates related to the playground can be adjusted.
